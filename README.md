# TaskLite: The "To The Point" Todo App

![Landing Page](./images/tasklite-landing-page.png)

## Description

Yes, it's ANOTHER Todo app! I won't beat around the bush and say mines amazing, I've created it for a couple reasons:

1. It was a nice simple project to be able to explore React and various storage options.
2. I wanted an app that forced me to be specific about my priorities for the day, hence the restricted number of todos.
3. It has provided some good hits of motivation by providing quick wins when I've been struggling with other, more complicated projects.

### So what sets this one apart?

As I've said above, I wanted a focused list of todos. This app restricts the number of todos you can have to 3. Once you've got 3 on your list the ability to add any more goes away, and you can only regain it by completing (or deleting) one or more from your list. At the moment the storage is temporary local storage but the next feature will be persistent local storage.
